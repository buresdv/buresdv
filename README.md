### Hey guys, I hope you're doing well

My name is Dave. I'm a Senior Technical Writer by day, and a Swift programmer for macOS by night. All my projects are Free and Open Source, so feel free to fork or modify any of them. If you think your changes are nice, don' hesitate to open a PR :)

## About My Programming Journey

I used to work as a web developer for a couple of years, but my true caling turned out to be technical writing and macOS programming. You can still see my webdev past:

I would not consider myself a god programmer, I just make apps that I would find useful :)
