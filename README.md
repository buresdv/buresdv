### Hey guys, I hope you're doing well

My name is Dave. I'm a Senior Technical Writer by day, and a Swift programmer for macOS by night. All my projects are Open Source, so feel free to open a PR :)

## My Programming Journey

I used to work as a web developer for a couple of years, but my true caling turned out to be technical writing and macOS programming. You can still see my webdev past:

Check out my stats:

I would not consider myself a good programmer, I just make apps that I would find useful :)

## Fun Facts About Me
- I can speak four languages fluently. ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ Czech, ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English, ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡® Slovene and ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡° Slovak. Furthermore, I am also conversational in ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ Chinese, ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ Japanese and, to a lesser degree, ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· Croatian and ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º Russian.
- My right shoulder had to be reconstructed due to multiple injuries playing volleyball. I still can't feel the shoulder.
- I have a shitty keyboard that has ghosting issues. That's why I sometimes write *don'* instead of *don't*, and *canÂ§* instead of *can't*.
